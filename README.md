The aim of these project is to find out the following:

**1. Is the hotel revenue growing by year?**: We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.

**2. Should the hotel increase parking lot size?**: 

**3. What trends can we see in the data?**: Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality

 In the course of ths project, we will:
- Build a database SQL server.
- Analyse and retrieve data with SQL.
- Connect PowerBI to a database and visualise data in PowerBi.
